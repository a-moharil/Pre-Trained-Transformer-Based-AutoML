		These features carry no predictive signal and should be manually investigated.
		This is typically a feature which has the same value for all rows.
		These features do not need to be present at inference time.

AutoGluon will gauge predictive performance using evaluation metric: 'root_mean_squared_error'
	This metric's sign has been flipped to adhere to being higher_is_better. The metric score can be multiplied by -1 to get the metric value.
	To change this, specify the eval_metric parameter of Predictor()
